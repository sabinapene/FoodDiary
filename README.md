# FoodDiary

The application has been coded by myself using android studio (Java) 
and Firebase (Dealtime Database and Authentication)

*Description of the application

My application, Food Diary, is meant to help users to keep track 
of their daily caloric intake and the food consumption for a better 
understanding of their eating habits as a way to stay healthy and 
fit. By creating an account in the app, it ensures that a backup of 
the daily entries for food consumption is created and it can be 
accessed from any phone as long as the user is logged in.
